Overview:

YelpCamp Review System

First thing I focused on is the Review model that we will use for our new feature.
I gave it a rating required field, which is an integer between 1 to 5,
corresponding to the number of stars given to a campground.
Also, there is a text field so a user can voice their opinion and explain why they gave a certain star rating.
